Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

Developed a robust machine learning model aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. This project involved working with real-world financial datasets to identify fraudulent patterns and reduce risks for financial institutions. Key highlights include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed large datasets with imbalanced classes to ensure accurate model training.
Modeling: Employed algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and XGBoost to classify fraudulent transactions.
Performance Optimization: Fine-tuned model parameters using grid search and cross-validation techniques to improve precision and recall.
Evaluation: Achieved a high F1-score by focusing on minimizing false positives while maintaining high accuracy.
Visualization: Utilized confusion matrices, ROC curves, and AUC scores for performance assessment.
This project sharpened my expertise in data science, machine learning, and fraud detection techniques, reinforcing my interest in solving real-world financial challenges through AI-driven solutions.
